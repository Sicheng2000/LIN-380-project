3,Source,Focused ultrasound can deliver energy safely and non-invasively into tissues at depths of centimetres.
4,Source,Here we show that the genetics and cellular functions of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) within tumours can be reversibly controlled by the heat generated by short pulses of focused ultrasound via a CAR cassette under the control of a promoter for the heat-shock protein.
5,Source,"In mice with subcutaneous tumours, locally injected T cells with the inducible CAR and activated via focused ultra-sound guided by magnetic resonance imaging mitigated on-target off-tumour activity and enhanced the suppression of tumour growth, compared with the performance of non-inducible CAR-T cells."
6,Source,Acoustogenetic control of the activation of engineered T cells may facilitate the design of safer cell therapies.
7,Source,Optogenetics enables the control of specific molecular events and cellular functions in living systems with high spatio-temporal resolutions.
8,Source,"However, optogenetics cannot reach deep tissues, with the penetration depth of light typically limited at micrometre to millimetre scales."
9,Source,Ultrasound can be focused to deliver mechanical energy safely and non-invasively into small volumes of tissue deep inside the body up to tens of centimetres.
10,Source,The rapidly oscillating pressure of focused ultrasound (FUS) waves and the resultant cycles of mechanical loading/unloading can lead to local heat generation in biological tissues.
11,Source,"Aided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) thermometry, FUS has been widely applied clinically to ablate tumours and to control drug delivery, vasodilation, neuromodulation and transgene expression."
12,Source,Transcription factors and genetic circuits have also been engineered to convert the FUS-generated heat into genetic regulation to control micro-bial systems in vivo.
13,Source,"However, there is a lack of general methods using FUS to control mammalian cell functions in vivo for therapeutic applications."
14,Source,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, where T cells are genetically programmed with redirected specificity against malignant cells, is becoming a paradigm-shifting approach for cancer treatment, especially for blood cancers."
15,Source,"However, major challenges remain for solid tumours before CAR-based immunotherapy can be widely adopted."
16,Source,"For instance, the non-specific targeting of the CAR-T cells against normal tissues (on-target off-tumour toxicities) can be life-threatening: off-tumour toxicities against the lung, the brain and the heart have caused multiple cases of deaths."
17,Source,"Immunosuppressive corticosteroid therapy and suicide-gene engineering are relatively effective in suppressing off-tumour toxicities and related cytokine release syndrome, but they fail to discriminate between beneficial T-cell functions and toxic side effects."
18,Source,"Synthetic biology and elegant genetic circuits have been used to enhance specificity and reduce off-tumour toxicity by creating chemically inducible dimerization of split CARs, inhibitory CARs and synthetic Notch (SynNotch) to control CAR activation."
19,Source,"However, given the extensive overlaps of antigens between solid tumours and normal tissues, especially those under conditions of tissue injury/inflammation, it remains very difficult to identify ideal antigens and their combinations to differentiate tumours from normal tissues."
20,Source,There is thus an urgent need for high-precision control of CAR-T cells to confine the activation at local sites of solid tumours.
21,Source,"Recently, we demonstrated that ultrasound signals can be amplified by microbubbles coupled to cells engineered with the mechanosensor Piezo1 to precisely control CAR- T-cell activation22."
22,Source,"However, the presence of micro- bubbles as cofactors limits the application of this system in vivo. "
23,Source,Here we have engineered a class of inducible CAR-T cells that can be acoustogenetically and directly controlled by FUS without any exogenous cofactor.
24,Source,We show that short-pulsed FUS stimulation can activate the engineered T cells at the desired time and location to suppress tumour growth in vivo with greater safety than standard CAR-T cells.
25,Source,Results
26,Source,Heat-induced reporter gene activation.
27,Source,"We propose to genetically engineer T cells with inducible CAR cassettes that can be remotely and directly activated without any exogenous cofactor, by MRI-guided FUS at local tumour sites for recognizing and eradicating tumour cells (Fig. 1a)."
28,Source,We first tested the inducible activation of a reporter eGFP under the control of the heat-shock-protein promoter (Hsp).
29,Source,We assembled a dual-promoter reporter construct containing the Hsp-driven eGFP and a constitutive mouse phosphoglycerate kinase 1 promoter (PGK)-driven mCherry (Fig. 1b).
30,Source,HEK293 T cells infected with the reporter lentivirus (Supplementary Fig. 1a) were heated at 43°C for 15 min.
31,Source,Real-time fluorescence imaging revealed that the heat-induced eGFP expression started as early as 2h after heat shock (HS) and persisted throughout the course of observation (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Video 1).
32,Source,"Quantitative tracking of the dynamics of heat-induced eGFP expression by flow cytometry showed that an average of 97% of the cells expressed eGFP at 6h post HS, and the percentage increased to 99% at 12h and remained stable for 2 d, while the mean fluorescence intensity peaked at 12h followed by a steady decrease (Fig. 1d)."
33,Source,We then investigated the inducible effect of HS in primary human T cells hosting the dual-promoter eGFP reporter (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
34,Source,"A 15min HS induced an eGFP expression in an average of 93% of the engineered T cells, in contrast to a background of 4% in control cells without HS (Fig. 1e,f)."
35,Source,The mean fluorescence intensity of the eGFP+ cells in the HS group was tenfold of that in the control group without HS (Fig. 1g).
36,Source,Heat-induced CAR expression and its functionality in Jurkat and primary human T cells.
37,Source,"To convert the transient heat stimulation to sustained gene activation and cellular functions for therapeutic actions, we integrated the Cre–lox gene switch into the inducible system."
38,Source,"The design is composed of two constructs, one containing the Hsp-driven Cre recombinase and the PGK-driven membrane c-Myc tag for cell sorting (‘inducible Cre’, Fig. 2a), and the other containing a lox-flanked ZsGreen-STOP sequence between PGK and an anti-CD19 CAR (‘lox-stop CAR reporter’, Fig. 2a)."
39,Source,"As such, the excision of the STOP cassette mediated by the transiently expressed heat-induced Cre can cause a switch from ZsGreen expression to a sustained CD19CAR production."
40,Source,We first tested this system in Jurkat T-cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
41,Source,"A 15min HS induced CAR expression in an average of 77% of the cells when measured 24h after HS (day 1), in contrast to an average basal level of 14% in control cells without HS and a minimal leakage of 0.6% in cells infected with the lox-stop CAR reporter alone (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2b)."
42,Source,"The heat-induced CAR expression remained stable when measured 6 d after HS (day 6, Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2b)."
43,Source,We further examined the functionality of the induced CD19CAR in the engineered cells (Fig. 2c).
44,Source,"Engineered Jurkat cells with HS or without (CT, control) HS were co-cultured with CD19-expressing Nalm-6 tumour cells for 24h."
45,Source,"Quantification of the expression level of CD69 (an early T-cell activation marker) revealed an average of 71% CD69+ cell population in the engineered Jurkat cells in the HS group, in contrast to an average of 14% in the CT group (Fig. 2d,e)."
46,Source,These results indicate that the HS-induced CD19CAR is efficient for functional changes in engineered Jurkat T cells. 
47,Source,"We then examined our system in primary human T cells (Fig. 2a,c and Supplementary Fig. 2c)."
48,Source,"Antibody staining showed that a 15min HS induced CAR expression in 29% of the T cells, in contrast to 1.9% in control cells without HS (Fig. 2f)."
49,Source,The heat-inducible CAR-T cells were then co-cultured with firefly luciferase (Fluc)-expressing Nalm-6 cells at different effector-to-target (E:T) ratios for cyto-toxicity assays.
50,Source,The luminescence of the remaining Nalm-6 cells was quantified after a 24 h co-culture.
51,Source,"The heat-stimulated T cells (HS) demonstrated increased cytotoxicity with increased E:T ratio, with the largest contrast in cytotoxicity being observed between the HS and the control (CT) T cells at E:T=1:5, eliminating 82.9% and 29.3% of the target tumour cells, respectively (Fig. 2g)."
52,Source,"The heat-stimulated CAR-T cells also secreted substantially higher concentrations of cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) than the control cells (Fig. 2h,i), verifying the functional capability gained by the HS-induced CAR-T cells. "
53,Source,"While the continuous 15min HS led to strong gene inductions (Figs. 1 and 2), it may cause toxicity to cells."
54,Source,We therefore investigated the effect of different HS patterns in primary human T cells (Supplementary Fig. 3).
55,Source,"Our results showed that longer HS resulted in more cell death; however, pulsed HS was able to alleviate this toxicity while achieving induction levels comparable to that in response to continuous HS with the same total heating time (Supplementary Fig. 3)."
56,Source,"In particular, a pulsed HS with 50% duty cycle and a total heating time of 15min (Supplementary Fig. 3a, pattern 2) caused a strong induction of eGFP expression in 91.4% of the engineered T cells with minimal toxicity (92.2% cell viability) measured 24h after HS (Supplementary Fig. 3b–d)."
57,Source,"Therefore, we applied this HS pattern (Supplementary Fig. 3a, pattern 2) for in vivo therapeutic studies."
58,Source,MRI-guided FUS-induced gene activation in phantom and in vivo.
59,Source,MRI-guided FUS enables the delivery of thermal energy in vivo at confined local regions with high spatiotemporal resolutions. We integrated a FUS system with a 7T MRI as described in Methods.
60,Source,An annular array transducer was placed above the target region of the object (phantoms or small animals) in the MRI bore. 
61,Source,"MR images were acquired and transferred to Thermoguide software to calculate the temperature of the target region in real time; this temperature was then fed back to the proportional-integral-derivative controller to automatically regulate the output power of the FUS generator, maintaining the temperature of the target region at the desired level (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4)."
62,Source,"We transduced Nalm-6 cells with a lentiviral dual-luciferase reporter containing inducible Fluc and constitutive Rluc (Hsp–Fluc–PGK–Rluc–mCherry; Rluc, Renilla luciferase; Fig. 3b) and embedded the cells in a tofu phantom (Fig. 3c and Methods)."
63,Source,We then focused the ultrasound on the embedded cells by changing the focal distance in the z direction.
64,Source,Three pulses of 5min FUS stimulations caused a significant induction of gene expression as quantified by the Fluc/Rluc ratio of the cells assayed 8h later (Fig. 3d and Methods).
65,Source,"The induction level was comparable to that of the positive control using a thermal cycler with the same heating pattern (Fig. 3d), suggesting that this approach can acoustogenetically control gene activation in engineered cells with high efficiency."
66,Source,"We then used MRI-guided FUS to control local temperature in vivo (Fig. 3e,f and Supplementary Video 2) and tested the FUS-induced gene activation using Nalm-6 cells with the dual-luciferase reporter in vivo in mice."
67,Source,"Significant gene induction was observed in the injected cells with only two pulses of 5min FUS stimulation (FUS+, after), compared with the basal level (FUS+, before) and the control groups (FUS–, before and after) (Fig. 3g,h)."
68,Source,FUS-inducible cytotoxicity of the engineered CAR-T cells in vivo.
69,Source,"To test the cytotoxicity of the FUS-inducible CAR (FUS-CAR) T cells in vivo, we subcutaneously injected Fluc+ Nalm-6 cells on both sides of NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice to generate matched bilateral tumours (Fig. 4a). "
70,Source,"Four days later, engineered CD19CAR T cells were injected subcutaneously at both tumour sites locally, followed by three pulses of 5min FUS stimulation at 43°C on the left but not on the right tumour (Fig. 4a)."
71,Source,"Our results showed that the growth of the left tumour was significantly suppressed compared with that of the right tumour, demonstrating the in vivo cytotoxicity of the FUS-CAR-T cells (Fig. 4b,c)."
72,Source,"We included a control group where bilateral-tumour-bearing mice received FUS stimulation on one side, with neither site subjected to the injection of T cells (Supplementary Fig. 5a)."
73,Source,"The tumours on both sides exhibited similar growth profiles, indicating that FUS itself (with the chosen pattern) had negligible impact on tumour growth (Supplementary Fig. 5b,c)."
74,Source,An additional control where bilateral-tumour-bearing mice received local injections of naive T cells on both tumours followed by FUS stimulation on the left tumour also showed similar growth profiles of both tumours (Supplementary Fig. 6). 
75,Source,"Therefore, our results demonstrated that FUS can be used to precisely control the cyto-toxicity of FUS-CAR-T cells in vivo against target tumour cells."
76,Source,"To further validate the effectiveness of our technology, we examined the cytotoxicity of the FUS-CAR-T cells against more established tumours."
77,Source,We subcutaneously injected Fluc+ Nalm-6 cells on the left side of NSG mice to generate a single tumour model.
78,Source,"Ten days after tumour challenge, FUS-CAR-T cells were locally injected at the tumour site and activated by FUS stimulation. "
79,Source,The control group received an injection of naive T cells followed by the same FUS stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 1a). 
80,Source,"FUS-CAR-T cells significantly suppressed tumour growth compared with the control, showing the efficacy of FUS-CAR-T-cell therapy in treating larger tumours (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d)."
81,Source,"Moreover, we tested this acoustogenetic technology in controlling inducible CAR-T cells against other types of tumours, particularly solid tumours."
82,Source,"We engineered human prostate cancer PC3 cells to express the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and Fluc, and engineered primary human T cells with the Cre–lox mediated FUS-inducible anti-PSMA CAR (PSMACAR; Extended Data Fig. 2a,b)."
83,Source,"We verified the functionality of the FUS-inducible PSMACAR T cells through in vitro co-culture cytotoxicity assays and the associated cytokine assays (Extended Data Fig. 2c,e)."
84,Source,"We then generated matched bilateral subcutaneous PC3 tumours (PSMA+, Fluc+) in NSG mice; five days later we subcutaneously injected FUS-inducible PSMACAR T cells locally at both tumour sites."
85,Source,"The tumour region on the left side was treated with three pulses of 5min FUS, while that on the right remained unstimulated. Consistently, the tumours with FUS stimulation showed significantly inhibited growth compared with the controls (Fig. 4d,e). "
86,Source,"We further collected the tumour tissues on the last day of monitoring (day 22, 17 d after FUS stimulation; Methods) and quantified the related messenger RNA amount."
87,Source,"CD3 mRNA in the FUS-treated tumours averaged threefold of that in the untreated ones, indicating more T-cell infiltration and/or expansion in the FUS-treated solid prostate tumours (Supplementary Fig. 7a). "
88,Source,"Moreover, the amount of Cre-mediated recombined CAR mRNA in the FUS-treated tumours was ninefold of that in the untreated controls, verifying the FUS-induced DNA recombination and subsequent CAR expression in the engineered T cells at the tumour sites (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Methods). "
89,Source,"Additionally, in a mock control where the bilateral PC3 tumour-bearing mice received local injections of naive T cells on both tumours followed by FUS stimulation only on the left tumour, no significant difference in growth between the left and right tumours was observed (Supplementary Fig. 8)."
90,Source,"These results demonstrate the efficacy of FUS-based acoustogenetics in the control of CAR-T cells for treating different types of tumours in vivo, including solid tumours of prostate cancer."
91,Source,Safety of FUS-CAR-T-cell therapy.
92,Source,We hypothesized that FUS-CAR-T cells have less on-target off-tumour toxicity than standard CAR-T cells with constitutive CAR expression. 
93,Source,"To test this, we adopted the above-mentioned bilateral Nalm-6 tumour model and treated the tumour on one side (the proximal tumour) with a local injection of the same number of standard CD19CAR T (Supplementary Fig. 9 and Methods) or FUS-inducible CD19CAR T cells. "
94,Source,"The distal tumour was used to mimic normal tissues expressing the target antigen and received no treatment (Supplementary Fig. 10a,b). "
95,Source,"Standard CAR-T cells not only eliminated the proximal tumour but also attacked the normal-tissue-mimicking distal tumour (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Fig. 10c). "
96,Source,"In contrast, FUS-CAR-T cells, after FUS activation, dramatically inhibited the growth of the proximal tumour, but spared the distal tumour (Fig. 5c,d and Supplementary Fig. 10d). "
97,Source,"Using tumour growth in control mice (with bilateral tumours, without T-cell treatment; Extended Data Fig. 3) as reference, we quantified the in vivo cyto-toxicity of the standard CAR and FUS-CAR-T cells on the last day of monitoring (Methods). "
98,Source,"Standard CAR-T cells demonstrated 100% and 99.8% cytotoxicity against proximal and distal tumours, respectively; FUS-CAR-T cells showed comparable effectiveness of 95.7% against proximal tumours, but merely 9.8% effectiveness against distal tumours (Fig. 5e)."
99,Source,"These results suggest that FUS-CAR-T-cell therapy is safer, with significantly less on-target off-tumour toxicity than the standard CAR-T-cell therapy."
100,Source,Developing a clinically compatible and reversible FUS-CAR-T cell. 
101,Source,"To minimize the usage of exogenous components in our technology for higher clinical compatibility, we further characterized a FUS-CAR-T cell where CAR expression was directly driven by Hsp (Hsp-CAR) without the Cre–lox switch, with PGK-driven mCherry as an indicator of gene delivery efficiency (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 11a)."
102,Source,"The FUS-CAR-T cell containing Hsp-CAR represents a reversible system: CAR expression reached an average of 43.9% in primary Hsp-CAR-T cells 6h after the first HS (43°C, 15min), which dwindled down to 10.5% at 12h and returned to a basal level comparable to that of the untreated control by 24h (Fig. 6b,c). "
103,Source,"When treated with a second HS (43°C, 15min), we observed CAR expression in an average of 44.2% of cells, followed by the same degradation dynamics (Fig. 6c), indicating the reversible nature of the Hsp-CAR system."
104,Source,"We examined the functionality of the reversible FUS-CAR-T cells using the cytotoxicity assay as described above, and observed stronger cytotoxicity of the FUS-CAR cells with HS activation than those without (Fig. 6d). "
105,Source,"The largest contrast was seen at an E:T ratio of 1:5, with the activated reversible FUS-CAR-T cells eliminating 83% of tumour cells compared with the 36% elimination by the control T cells (Fig. 6d). "
106,Source,The specific killing was verified by cytokine secretions (Fig. 6e).
107,Source,"To investigate the performance of the reversible FUS-CAR-T cells in vivo, we generated bilateral Fluc+ Nalm-6 tumours in NSG mice. "
108,Source,The tumour on one side (proximal tumour) received a local injection and FUS activation of the reversible FUS-CAR-T cells; this treatment was repeated on day 4 and day 7 (Supplementary Fig. 11b). 
109,Source,The contralateral distal tumour received no treatment. 
110,Source,"Our results showed that the growth of the proximal tumour was drastically inhibited compared with that of the distal tumour (Fig. 6f,g), demonstrating sufficient efficacy and minimal side effect of the reversible FUS-CAR-T cells. "
111,Source,"In a control group where the proximal tumour was repeatedly stimulated by FUS on day 4 and day 7 but without T-cell administration, the proximal tumour demonstrated similar aggressiveness as the distal tumour, suggesting that the repeated FUS stimulation itself had no direct effect on tumour growth (Extended Data Fig. 4). "
112,Source,We also included a control group where the proximal tumour received local injections of the reversible FUS-CAR-T cells on day 4 and day 7 but without FUS stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 5a). 
113,Source,"While the growth of the proximal tumour slightly slowed down, probably due to basal CAR expressions and allogeneic responses of the T cells, it still demonstrated an average of 1,318-fold growth by day 24 (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). "
114,Source,"Taken together, our results demonstrate the reversibility, efficacy and safety of the reversible FUS-CAR-T cells that minimized the use of clinically untested exogenous components."
