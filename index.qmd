## Project title

"Reader-Oriented Translation Approach: A Case Study on Translating Biomedical Literature" involves a referential analysis targeting the numbers of metadiscourse markers in the source text and its translation to test the effectiveness of translation methods. The results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference in the numbers of metadiscourse markers between the source and target texts.

## Reproduce
